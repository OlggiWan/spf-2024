# Week 2 Learning Objectives
## The Interstellar Medium: the ingredients of planetary systems
*Motivation*: Understanding the ISM can help us understand the Galactic context of planet formation. Stars are born alongside their planetary systems. In this way, star and planet formation are fundamentally coupled processes: the pathway to planet formation is through the ISM. In order to understand how the raw materials of stars and planets are assembled, we have to understand the physics driving the assemblage and distribution of interstellar material in the Galaxy. Understanding ISM physics is also necessary in order to interpret observations, both in our own Galaxy and in others, where have access to information about star formation at much larger scales through ISM tracers. 

*Guiding Questions*:
### I. What are the dynamical drivers of star stuff in the Galaxy?
+ Introduction to pressure sources in the ISM: thinking about pressure balance as a framework
*Chapter 5, Williams*
  + The Two Phase Neutral Medium  
  + Heating and Cooling in the ISM  
  + Structure of the MW gas disk  
+ Beyond quasi-statics: kinematics
*Chapter 8, Williams*  
  + Intro to fluid dynamics
  + The Virial Theorem
  + Turbulence and velocity dispersions

### Updates and Reminders
1. HW 1 is due by EOD Friday 2/9 in the w1 submissions folder: [Full Instructions](https://github.com/akuznetsova/spf-2024/issues/1)

### Recaps
*Feb 5*: [recap](./Feb-5-recap.md)  
*Feb 7*:  

### Menu suggestions
*Some suggestions for appropriate menu assignments. You are not limited to these examples nor the posted references*  
* Resource contribution: add screenshots of relevant calculations from Tools of Radio Astronomy to last week's recap.
* Resource contribution: add an example image of an extinction curve to last week's recap. Write a caption for it. 
* Resource contribution: add a question or describe a point of confusion to last week's recap.  
* Annotated bibliography: write up an entry in the annotated bibliography for a section of Kalberla & Kerp (2009). To avoid duplication, post in the [assignment thread](https://github.com/akuznetsova/spf-2024/issues/4) with the section you're working on.  
* Resource contribution: upload an example of an ISM cooling function to this week's folder (can be a plot or equations). Write a commit message relating it to the material covered in class.

### HW 2 Objectives (due next Friday 2/15) 
1. Measure the neutral hydrogen column density from HI 21cm line measurements
2. Construct a model to calculate the equilibrium temperature from cooling and heating in the ISM

** Assignment Instructions **  
This assignment is hosted as a [Jupyter notebook](./HW2-[NAME].ipynb), a copy of which is in this weeks folder.
To receive credit for this assignment, please commit your copy of the notebook (with all code executed and plots generated) to the course github in the week 2 submissions folder with the commit title of HOMEWORK 2 - [NAME] and leave a reply in the [Assignment thread](https://github.com/akuznetsova/spf-2024/issues/6) with a link to the submission.
