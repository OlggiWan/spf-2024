## Topic: Fluid Dynamics

## Summary

In this lecture we began with a recap of fluid dynamics which consists of the conservation of mass, conservation of momentum as well as the conservation of energy in which the conservation of energy lead us to the wave equation once it was derived. This lead us to the virial theorem in order to describe the behavior. Further, we went over an equation made by Larson in 1981 which concluded that the observed behavior was due to turbulence. ```

## Outline 

Consider a cube of length dv, where $overline{v}$ 
and rho is the mass density of the cube and $dm= rho * dv$

### Conservation of Mass
$ Mass = mass_{in} - mass_{out}$

### Mass Flux equation:
$int\int\int\rho * mu \cdot \hat{n} dA$
$int\nabla \cdot(rho*u)=0$

$frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot(rho*u)=0$  Continity equation

Lagrangian/ Convective Derivative
$\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = \frac{D \rho}{Dt} + \nabla \cdot(rho*u)=0$
