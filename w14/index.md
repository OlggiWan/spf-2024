# Week 14 Learning Objectives
## Planet-forming Disks: the birthplaces of planets
Motivation: Planet-forming disks are where planets are assembled, in order to understand what determines the composition and architecture of planetary systems, we have to understand how the raw ingredients from the ISM are processed, transformed, and transported within planet-forming environments. 

### The Business of Planet Formation: Coagulation and Growth
- coagulation, pebble accretion, streaming instability
- planetesimals, planetary embryos, runaway and oligarchic growth
- giant planets: isolation mass, gap opening, and perturbing disks
- planet-disk interaction intro: the mysteries of migration

### Updates and Reminders
+ Project pitches May 8th (in class discussion)
+ All assignments for the semester have been released (no new homework until the end of the course)
