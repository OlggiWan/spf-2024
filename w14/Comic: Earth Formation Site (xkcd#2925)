A comic that makes light of where the planet Earth assembled in the solar system, specifically referring to how the Earth assembled from a cloud of dust and gas gravitationally collapsing. Note that while gravo-turbulent collapse might be good enough for assembling grains via streaming instabilities, one should also consider assembly by collisions and mass transfer mechanisms. But also, silly comic that is meant to be taken lightly.
