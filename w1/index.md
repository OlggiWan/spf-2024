# Week 1 Learning Objectives
## The Interstellar Medium: the ingredients of planetary systems
*Motivation*: Understanding the ISM can help us understand the Galactic context of planet formation. Stars are born alongside their planetary systems. In this way, star and planet formation are fundamentally coupled processes: the pathway to planet formation is through the ISM. In order to understand how the raw materials of stars and planets are assembled, we have to understand the physics driving the assemblage and distribution of interstellar material in the Galaxy. Understanding ISM physics is also necessary in order to interpret observations, both in our own Galaxy and in others, where have access to information about star formation at much larger scales through ISM tracers. 

*Guiding Questions*:
### I. What is star stuff and where does it come from?   
(but also let's review radiative transfer concepts)
#### Dust: All the things we can not see 
*Chapter 4, Williams; [MRN, 1977](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1977ApJ...217..425M/abstract)*
  + Radiative transfer: absorption and emission with Mie Theory
  + Understanding ISM extinction curves 
  + Size distribution of dust in the ISM
#### Gas: Phases of the ISM and how we trace them
*Chapter(s) (3) & 5, Williams*   
A review of some important emission mechanisms and their use as diagnostics of physical processes
  + The Cold & Warm Neutral Medium
    + Collisional Equlibrium and the HI 21 cm line
    + How do we know the Gas-to-Dust Ratio in the ISM?
  + The Warm Ionized Medium
    + Line Emisson: Ionization, Recombination, and Collisional Equilibrium
    + Continuum Emission: Bremsstrahlung + Synchrotron (brief cameo)

### [Recap](./Jan-30-recap.md)
### Homework Objectives:
Construct a dust model of the ISM:
- Get comfortable with the mathematical treatment of size distributions to build physical intuition
- Identify the sources of uncertainty for characterizing interstellar dust from observables
- Understand the wavelength dependent behavior of dust absorption and emission

**Assignment Instructions**   
This assignment is hosted as a [Jupyter notebook](./HW1-[NAME].ipynb), a copy of which is in this weeks folder.
For ease of dealing with the external packages needed, the notebook is hosted on a publically accessible binder hub at Flatiron Institute. 
Please read the [instructions](https://wiki.flatironinstitute.org/Public/UsingFiBinder) for using the binder hub.

You can access the binder hub for this course at: [https://binder.flatironinstitute.org/~akuznetsova/models](https://binder.flatironinstitute.org/~akuznetsova/models)
or by heading to [https://binder.flatironinstitute.org/](https://binder.flatironinstitute.org/) and entering

owner: `akuznetsova`
project: `models`

The folder will contain the github folder for this course titled `spf-2024` in which you will find copies of the homework notebooks and course materials as well as the libraries installed for running any of the code. Anything you generate with binder is hosted on a server unique to you, the server will run keeping all your notebooks, data, and computations until you shut it down (or after 7 days of inactivity). 

You can download the notebook you ran and any files you generate directly to your computer using the `Download` button. 
*Please remember to rename the notebook from the template name prior to submission*

To receive credit for this assignment, please commit your copy of the notebook (with all code executed and plots generated) to the course github in the week 1 submissions folder with the commit title of HOMEWORK 1 - [NAME] and leave a reply in the [Assignment thread](https://github.com/akuznetsova/spf-2024/issues/1) with a link to the submission.

### Final Objectives:  
(i.e. where we are aiming to be at the end of this course)  
*Synthesis:* Re-construct the argument for distribution derived in the original (MRN,1977) paper.
