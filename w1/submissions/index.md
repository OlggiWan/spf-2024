## Week 1: Submissions

**Pre-Class Assignment (1/29):**  
> In our first class, we'll be having a (very informal) discussion as a class about big picture questions and topics in the field. 
> To guide our conversation, I'd like everyone to bring in a textbook diagram/schematic/infographic/cartoon/artist representation of your choice depicting or explaining some aspect of star and planet formation. It can come from a textbook, a paper, a talk, a NASA media resource, wikipedia gallery, etc. It can be a picture, screenshot, jpg/png.
