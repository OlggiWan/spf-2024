This is the same model as run_ppdisk_simple_1, but now with two dust species:
one small grain species and a midplane layer of large grains. The mass of the
disk is increased compared to run_ppdisk_simple_1.

The "fracbig" variable sets the ratio of how much of the dust mass is in the big
grains. The opacity files have been created in:

  ../../opac/dust_continuum/dustopac_for_example_models/

How to run this model:

  python problem_setup.py
  radmc3d mctherm setthreads 4

and then in Python:

  %run problem_plotexamples.py
