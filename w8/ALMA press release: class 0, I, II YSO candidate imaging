ALMA press release detailing YSO features and evolution for class 0 / I/ II YSO candidates. A notable image is toward the bottom of the article, which shows a progression of objects, their classification, and the best estimated age. Note that some older class I disks (as well as class II candidates) have a 'hole' which may be due to outflows creating a cavity in the envelope surrounding the YSO. There are also the presence of rings, or better said gaps, which are theorized to the the sites of planet formation. These gaps may appear early than thought, as further detailed in the press release.
