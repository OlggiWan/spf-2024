# Week 8 Learning Objectives
## Young Stellar Objects (YSO)
Motivation: Just like the population level properties of main sequence and evolved stars open a door into the behavior and evolution of stars, the population level characterization of young stellar objects can give us hints as to the physical properties of young stars. 

### I. YSOs: The protostar as a star
  + Pre-Main Sequence
  + YSO Ages
  + YSO Accretion
  + Detection: IR and X-ray

### II. The Protostellar Class System
  + Dust Opacities (in disks!)
  + Spectral Energy Distributions
    
### Updates and Reminders
