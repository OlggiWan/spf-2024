# Week 8 Learning Objectives
## Young Stellar Objects (YSO)
Motivation: Just like the population level properties of main sequence and evolved stars open a door into the behavior and evolution of stars, the population level characterization of young stellar objects can give us hints as to the physical properties of young stars. 


Detection: When does all this become a star anyway?
YSO tracks: the protostar as a star
The "birthline" and why protostellar ages are hard
YSOs: the IR revolution
Dust opacities again (in disks this time!)
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs)

### I. YSOs: The protostar as a star
  + Pre-Main Sequence

  + Detection: IR and X-ray

### II. The Protostellar Class System
  + Dust Opacities (in disks!)
  + Spectral Energy Distributions
