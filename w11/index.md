# Week 11 Learning Objectives
## Planet-forming Disks: the birthplaces of planets
Motivation: Planet-forming disks are where planets are assembled, in order to understand what determines the composition and architecture of planetary systems, we have to understand how the raw ingredients from the ISM are processed, transformed, and transported within planet-forming environments. 

### Observing Disks 
- Intro to radio interferometry
- Deep dive into ALMA
- PV diagrams, Keplerian masks, channel maps
- Introduction to astrochemistry

### HW 11 Objectives
Due EOD: Friday April 12th  
1. Install RADMC-3D

**Assignment Instructions**
We are going to play around with radiative transfer calculations using an MCMC method. For this, we will first (attempt) to install the code on everyone's computer. (A general skill that everyone will at some point have to deal with when using astronomical software). 
Follow the quickstart instructions [here](https://www.ita.uni-heidelberg.de/~dullemond/software/radmc-3d/manual_radmc3d/quickstart.html) to install and test radmc3d on your machine.
For credit, please submit your final `image.out` from the last step with the title `[Name]-image.out` in the week 11 submissions folder. 

If things have not gone well, submit a screenshot indicating which step you are on, what errors you are getting, and what debugging steps you have attempted to receive credit.
