# Class Recap: Week No.4 - Feb 21
## Topic: Molecular Clouds

### Summary
In class, we dicussed Molecular Clouds as they are where star can form and when self-gravitating becomes important. We discussed Thermal Pressure v Gravity and derived the dispersion relation. We also discussed the how to formation and destruction of Neutral Hydrogen. It is formed on grains (very slowly). It is destroyed by dissociation; Thermal or Photoelectric. We talked about the Interstellar Radiation Field introduced by Habing (1968) and the concept of self-shielding. We ended the class with a brief introduction to Orion Complex.

### Outline 

###### Thermal Pressure v Gravity:
###### Mass:
$\frac{\partial \rho'}{\partial t} + \bar{p} \frac{\partial u'}{\partial x} = 0$\
###### Momentum:
$\frac{\partial u'}{\partial t} + \frac{1}{\bar\rho} \frac{\partial p'}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial \Phi}{\partial x}$\

###### We then take the time derivation of Mass and the spatial derivation of momentum and plug in the Poisson equation:
###### Poisson:
$\Delta^2 \Phi = 4\pi G \rho$ 

###### We end up with:
$\frac{\partial^2 \rho'}{\partial t^2} -c_s^s \frac{\partial^2 P'}{\partial x^2} = 4 \pi G \bar{\rho} \rho'$\
###### Using the relationship:
$\rho (x,t) \propto e^{i(wt-kx)}$ 
###### The equations goes to :
$-w^2 e^{i(wt-kx)} - c_s^2 k^2 e^{i(wt-kx)} = 4 \pi G \bar{\rho}e^{i(wt-kx)}$ \
###### Solving for $w^2$ we get the dispersion relation:
$w^2 = k^2c_s^2 - 4 \pi G \bar{\rho}$\
If $w^2>0$ we get a wave\
If $w^2<0$ we get a growth (instability) \

###### To find the thresholds for the unstable modes:
$k_j=(\frac{ 4 \pi G \bar{\rho}}{c_s^2})^{\frac{1}{2}}$  \
$L = \frac{2\pi}{k}$ where $L>L_j> (\frac{\pi}{G\bar{\rho}})^{\frac{1}{2}}c_s$  Jean's Length \
$p_{th} = \rho c_s^2$ \
$p_grav \sim \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial R}R \sim \rho \Delta \Phi R \sim \rho \frac{GMR}{R_2^2}$ \
$R_j \sim \frac{c_s}{\rho^{\frac{1}{2}}}$ \
$M_j \sim  \frac{4\pi}{3}(\frac{L_j}{2})^2 \bar{\rho} = \frac{1}{a}(\frac{\pi^5}{G^3 \bar{\rho}})^{\frac{1}{2}} c_s^2$ \

###### The Real values:
$R_j = 1.2pc(\frac{T}{10})^{\frac{1}{2}} (\frac{n}{100cm^3})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ \
$M_j = 10M_{\odot}(\frac{T}{10})^{\frac{3}{2}} (\frac{n}{100cm^3})^{-\frac{1}{2}}$ \
$n =4 \times 10^4 cm^{-3}$ 

###### Formation:
* On dust grains (very slow)\

###### Destruction: Dissociation
* binding energy : 4.5eV
* 1 eV = $1.6 \times 10^{-12}$ ergs
* $k_b$ = $1.37 \times 10^{-16}$ ergs
###### Thermal Dissociation (collisions):\
$\frac{5}{2}kT = 4.5 eV$\
$T \approx 10^4 K$\
###### Photo Dissociation:\
$\frac{hc}{\lambda} = 4.5eV$ \
$\lambda = 0.2 \mu m$ [UV] \
$\lambda = \frac{2898 \mu m}{T}$  where T= 20000K
###### Interstellar Radiation Field (ISRF)
* Habing (1968)
* $1G_0 = 1.6 \times 10^{-3}$ ergs\$cm^2$\s
###### Self-Shielding
* $A_{\nu} > 0.3 for H_2$
* $A_{\nu} \sim \frac{N_H}{1.8 \times 10^{21}cm^{-2}} where N_H = 6 \times 10^{20}$
* $\Delta S \cong 200pc$ >> molecular clouds
