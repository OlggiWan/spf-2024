# Week 4 Learning Objectives
## Molecular Clouds: the birthplaces of stars 
*Motivation*: Molecular clouds are where stars form, understanding what we do and don't know about molecular clouds is important for how we think about star formation at large. Learning about the greater context of historical assumptions about molecular clouds is important for contextualizing where the literature is coming from

*Guiding Questions*:

I. Why do we care about molecular clouds?
+ The Jean's Length as the scale of thermal vs gravitational pressure
+ Self-gravitation across scales: Bondi accretion

II. What is a molecular cloud, actually?
+ Photodissociation Regions
+ Case study: Orion
