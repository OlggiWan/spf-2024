# Class Recap: Week No. - March-18
## Topic: Premain Sequence Stars

## Summary
```
We began with an outline of our midterm exam. We then revised all that encompasses pre main sequence stars which includes:
How energy is produced, how energy is transported, hydrostatic equilibrium (HSEQ), their properties, conservation of mass,
 momentum conservation, energy conservation, radiation, convection Schwartzchild criterion, and virial theorem.
See the outline for further details on each of these topics.

# Outline 

## Midterm Presentation

 ### Context
+ spacial/timescales
+  Role/stage in star formation
+ How is it studied (how it is studied. Be broad)

### Case Study
+ name of region/object
+ tracers, wavelength, facility
+ what was measured
+ what was learned

## Pre-main sequence stars
1st hydrostatic core
2nd hydrostatic core


$t_{KH} = \frac{G M}{R_* L_*}$
