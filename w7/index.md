# Week 7 Learning Objectives
## Magnetic Fields
Motivation: Magnetic fields are present in the ISM -- we have a few techniques for establishing the magnetic field strength in and around star-forming environments. We know that magnetic fields should be important for angular momentum transport and accretion in circumstellar disks. Understanding when and what scale magnetic fields are dominant during star formation is pivotal for our understanding of star and planet formation.

### I. What about magnetic fields?
  + Magnetic fields in the ISM
  + Flux-freezing and ideal MHD
  + Measuring magnetic fields - Zeeman Splitting + Polarization

### II. The case for non-ideal MHD 
  + Magnetic Jean's Masses
  + The Magnetic Braking Catastrophe
  + Non-ideal MHD: Ambipolar diffusion
    
### Updates and Reminders
+ Good time to pick out your midterm presentation topic! - [Midterm instructions](https://github.com/akuznetsova/spf-2024/issues/12)

### References:
[Richard Fitzpatrick's MHD notes](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/plasma/Plasma/node84.html): An excellent resource for working through the math. (He also has a really nice [fluid mechanics course](https://farside.ph.utexas.edu/teaching/336L/Fluid/) among many others)

### HW 7: Prep for [Midterm](https://github.com/akuznetsova/spf-2024/issues/12) 
Menu pts: Upload the paper for the observational study you are thinking of using in your midterm presentation in the submissions folder by EOD Friday 03/22, with the title [TOPIC]-paper for additional points. (Good way to get feedback before the midterm!)
