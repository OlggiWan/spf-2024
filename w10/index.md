# Week 10 Learning Objectives
## Planet-forming Disks: the birthplaces of planets
Motivation: Planet-forming disks are where planets are assembled, in order to understand what determines the composition and architecture of planetary systems, we have to understand how the raw ingredients from the ISM are processed, transformed, and transported within planet-forming environments. 

### Disk Models 101
- The wonderful world of disk physics
  - Alpha disks from the ground up
  - LBP Viscous Evolution
  - Angular momentum transport (MRI, GI, winds)
  - Radiation Transport in disk atmospheres

### HW 10 Objectives
Due EOD: Friday April 5th  
(I'm using the midterm hiatus to reset the numbering scheme to make the homeworks go with the week they are due)  

1. Build a simple slab model for the continuum emission from a disk.
2. Use this slab model to predict the spectral energy distribution (SED) for optically thin disk emission. 

**Assignment Instructions**
This assignment is hosted as a [Jupyter notebook](./HW10-[NAME].ipynb), a copy of which is in this weeks folder.
To receive credit for this assignment, please commit your copy of the notebook (with all code executed and plots generated) to the course github in the week 10 submissions folder with the commit title of HOMEWORK 10 - [NAME] and leave a reply in the [Assignment thread](https://github.com/akuznetsova/spf-2024/issues/18) with a link to the submission.
