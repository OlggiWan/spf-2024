# Week 3 Learning Objectives
## The Interstellar Medium: the ingredients of planetary systems
*Motivation*: The ISM is often used as an initial condition for star formation. Here we want to understand the energy budget of the ISM and start to put together an understanding of ISM as a dynamic place, governed by different forces at different scales. 

*Topics*:

I. Some Basic Fluid Dynamics Continued
  + Shocks, shocks, shocks!
  + Heating source of the ionized medium

II. Supernova Remnants
 + The three phases of classical SN solution
 + Understanding SNR in terms of shocks

### Recaps
*Feb 14*: 


### HW 3 Objectives
1. Construct a three phase model for supernovae remnant expansion
2. Practice using metrics for turbulence generation
