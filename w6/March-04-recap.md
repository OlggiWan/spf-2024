## Topic: Protostar & Disk Formation

### Summary
```
In this lecture we went over the details of protostar formation, and how angular momentum plays a part in the formation of disks.  
```

### Outline 
```
We previously modeled our pre-protostellar cores with a bonner-ebert sphere, and now we will take a look at what happens as that core collapses. Depending on the angular momentum
of a particular piece of the core, it will either end up as part of the protostar or the disk.

Self similar models:
  * Larston-Penston: $\rho \approx \rho_c$, r--->0, $v \sim r$
  * Shu (1977): $dM/dt = 4 \pi r^2 \rho c_s = 0.975 c_s^3/G$

Hydrostatic Cores: (for 1 solar mass core)
  * 1st core: $R \approx 2au$, $M \approx 10^{-3} M_{sun}$
  * 2nd core: $R \approx 1.8x10^{-2}au$, $M \approx 4.6x10^{-3} M_{sun}$

A star is borm (kelvin Helmholtz time): $t_{KH} \approx GM^2/RL$
  * for 1 $M_{sun}$, 1 $R_{sun}$, 1 $L_{sun}$, $t_{KH} \approx 31$ Myr

Protostar Catagories:
  * T-Tauri: 0.1<$M_{sun}$<2
  * Herbig A/B: 2<$M_{sun}$<8

Accretion Luminosity: $L_{acc}= 9.3(M/M_{sun})(M_{in}/10^{-6})(R/R_{sun})^{-1}L_{sun}$

Angular momentum: $L=I \Omega$, $I=\frac{2}{5}MR^2$

Specific Angular momentum: $j=\Omega R^2$

If angular momentum is conserved: $\Omega _{*} = \Omega _c (\frac{R_c}{R_*})^2$

For $R_c \sim 0.2$ pc, $\Omega _c=10^{-15}$ rad/s, and $R_* = 3R_{sun}$:
    $T=2\pi / \Omega _* \approx 10$ minutes ---- MUCH faster than our sun, so much be losing angular momentum.

Angular momentum solutions:
  * Outflows
  * Disk
  * Magnetic braking
  * Binary Companion
