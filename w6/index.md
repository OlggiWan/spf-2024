# Week 6 Learning Objectives
## Modeling Disk Formation
Motivation: Cores collapse on short dynamical timescales in highly extincted environments, making disk formation a really hard process to empirically constrain.
The tools used to understand this short lived phase have been developed analytically by theorists over several decades. In order to understand the 

### I. On the brink of collapse: modeling blobs
  + Singular Isothermal Sphere, Bonner-Ebert Spheres
  + First core, second core: earliest stages
  + Self-similar solutions (Shu models)
### II. Angular momentum: how things go round
  + Disk Formation: Rotating collapse
  + Ballistic trajectories and some orbital mechanics
