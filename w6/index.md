# Week 6 Learning Objectives
## Modeling Disk Formation
Motivation: Cores collapse on short dynamical timescales in highly extincted environments, making disk formation a really hard process to empirically constrain.
The tools used to understand this short lived phase have been developed analytically by theorists over several decades. In order to understand the 

### I. On the brink of collapse: modeling blobs
  + Singular Isothermal Sphere, Bonner-Ebert Spheres
  + First core, second core: earliest stages
  + Self-similar solutions (Shu models)
### II. Angular momentum: how things go round
  + Disk Formation: Rotating collapse
  + Ballistic trajectories and some orbital mechanics
    
### Updates and Reminders

[Bhandare, 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A&A...618A..95B/abstract): a nice paper focused on fully numerically simulating with radiation hydrodynamics (so as to capture the change in equation of state) in 1D the collapse of a core, resolving the formation of the first and second hydrostatic core. We discussed Figure 3 in class. 
### HW 6: TBD
