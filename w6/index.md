# Week 6 Learning Objectives
## Modeling Disk Formation
Motivation: Cores collapse on short dynamical timescales in highly extincted environments, making disk formation a really hard process to empirically constrain.
The tools used to understand this short lived phase have been developed analytically by theorists over several decades. In order to understand the 

### I. On the brink of collapse: modeling blobs
  + Singular Isothermal Sphere, Bonner-Ebert Spheres
  + First core, second core: earliest stages
  + Self-similar solutions (Shu models)
### II. Angular momentum: how things go round
  + Disk Formation: Rotating collapse
  + Ballistic trajectories and some orbital mechanics
    
### Updates and Reminders
+ Good time to start thinking about your midterm presentation topic! - [Midterm instructions](https://github.com/akuznetsova/spf-2024/issues/12)  
+ Starting this week: homeworks will be worth 5 points (rather than 4 points) to adjust for the fact that there will be no homework assigned to be due the week of the midterm or after the last week of class.

### References:
[Bhandare, 2018](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018A&A...618A..95B/abstract): a nice paper focused on fully numerically simulating with radiation hydrodynamics (so as to capture the change in equation of state) in 1D the collapse of a core, resolving the formation of the first and second hydrostatic core. We discussed Figure 3 in class. 

### HW 6 Objectives
1. Use principles of angular momentum conservation to figure out the time evolution of the disk radius during disk formation.
2. Understand how the assumption of initial cloud rotation affects the resulting disk properties
