# Star and Planet Formation 
In this course, we will lay the foundation for our current understanding of star and planet formation, from physical processes in the interstellar medium on giant molecular cloud scales down to the assembly of planets. We will discuss how observational evidence informs the theoretical picture of how stars and planets are born in our Galaxy, learn how to construct basic models of planet-forming environments , and survey open questions in the field.

# Course Outline
## Part 1: Star Formation in the Galaxy
### The Interstellar Medium: the ingredients of planetary systems
- What is star stuff and where does it come from?
