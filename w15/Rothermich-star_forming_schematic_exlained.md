### Explanation of Schematic

For my contribution, I wanted to modify one of the cartoons from our first week. I liked the idea of the cartoon originally, which was to place star and planet formation
into context with the larger picture of cloud collapse. The original version, however, seemed to be lacking some information (such as scales) which didnt leave the viewer 
with the clearest picture of what was happening. So the first thing I changed was adding "insets" and size descriptors, so that the viewer had a good idea of sizes, as
well as when the cartoon was looking at a zoomed in portion, such as when it talks about the clumps within a cloud and then moves on to a protostar. Next I cleaned up
some of the language for the viewer, so they understood why the molecular cloud would collapse in the first place. 

The original cartoon was designed in a circular fashion, as if suggesting a cycle, yet they ended it after solar system formation. In order to complete the "cycle" 
that is expected by the viewer based on the design, I added an extra step connecting the death of stars into the replenishment of gas and dust for new stars. In doing so,
it is hoped that the viewer gains insight into how the metallicity of stars becomes more and more metal rich with successive generations of stars. 

While the final cartoon I created comes off a bit "messy" to the eye, I feel it does a better job than the original at giving the viewer a more complete view of the scales 
of star formation.
