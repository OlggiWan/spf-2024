Due: May 22nd

Turn in your own cartoon image/schematic for representing star and planet formation based on what you've learned in class. 
You can choose to directly improve one from [the week 1 gallery](../w1/gallery.md) or simply focus on an aspect of star/planet formation you'd like to represent. 
Additional points will be given for written reflection directly discussing the communication strategies in your version, engagement with the course material, or the literature.
