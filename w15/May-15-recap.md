## Topic: Disk dispersal and dynamics 

### Summary
This week in SPF, we covered some of the last bits of protostellar and protoplanetary assembly. We begin by discussing disk dispersial  (for the gas) either through disk evolution or photoevaporation. We then take a look at what's leftover: maybe some planets and planetesimals. And dust. We talk about the dynamics governing this system, discuss planet migration scenarios, debris disks, and a final coverage of what we see when we are looking for "young planets." 

### Outline 
How does disk dispersal work for the gas? We can consider a two methods: 

1. Disk evolution (via viscous spreading, magnetic disk wind accretion). In the classic T-Tauri stage (Class II, CTTS), we can measure $\dot{M} \sim 10^{-8} \ - \ 10^{-9} \ {\rm M}_\odot \ {\rm yr}^{-1}$ from H$\alpha$ lines. The timescale of this evolution is too long (10 - 100 Myr) when compared to the average of a T-tauri system (3 - 10 Myr).
2. Photoevaporation. If the midplane is where most of the mass is in the system, you have diffuse layers that can be heated up by the central star. This heating process can heat the material beyond the equilibrium temperature, where if the thermal energy exceeds the gravitational energy, a photoevaporative flow is produced. Note that the relevant energy ranges include EUV (> 13.6 eV which leads to an ionization front similar to HII expansion), X-rays (0.1 - 10 keV), and FUV (6 - 13.6 eV).

What is left after the gas is gone? 
* planets?
* planetismals?
* dust?
  * note: planetismals + dust = debris disks 

So what are the dynamics governing the system without the gas? Aka what are the things that can futher impact planet(esimal) sizes, orbits, etc.? 
1. planet-planet scattering (akin to bremsstrahlung). If scattering is strong, you can fling stuff out of the disk. Giant planets are very effective at this. Drammatic.
2. dynamical friction / breaking (akin to dark matter effects on satelllites). Can also be called planetesimal scattering.
3. tidal migration (common mechanism for giant planets). If a planet is large enough, it can induce a tidal bulge in the center star.
4. Secular evolution (see Lidov-Kozai mechanism)

Another (potentially) important factor: mean motion resonances (MMR) where $P_{\rm orb, 1} = n P_{\rm orb, 2}$. Pluto:Neptune = 2:3 ... 

Another (another) (potentially) important factor: Grand Tack Scenario. Wacky stuff. 

Debris disk are also detectable in the IR (1 - 100 $\mu m$) and are typically found around main sequence stars as opposed to pre-main sequence. This detectable dust is considered 2nd generation dust. Recall: collisional outcomes can result in mergers (growth), erosions / cratering, bouncing, and fragmentation / grinding (the most likely in a debris disk). These processes generate 2nd generation dust. 

Note: ~45% of stars have debris disk, where the most common stars to have them are A or B stars. Age of these disks are typically > 100 Myr. 

Why do we have debris disks? Radiation pressure exerts a force that results in an angular momentum loss (Poynting-Robertson Drag) via: 

$F = \frac{v_k}{c^2} P_{\rm in} = \frac{R^3}{4c^2} L_\odot \sqrt{\frac{G M_* }{r^5}} $

Debris disks may be the main hope for finding remnants of planet formation. What are the ways to find remnants?
* debris disks (exo-zodis)
* chondrite meteorites
* trojan asteroids
* polluted white dwarves

What do we see when we see "young planets"?
* direct imaging (thermal emission -> hot) (cold vs. hot start)
* protoplanet(s) PDS 70b(c?) look for H$\alpha$ (accretion indicator)
