The schematic I have submitted is a condensed version of the slides I gave for the midterm detailing key morphological, spectral, and age features of YSOs, specifically class 0 / I / II disks. My communication strategy for the schematic was to guide the viewer by eye from left-to-right on how YSOs evolve. The top row of the schematic showcased morphological features of the YSOs, such as the presence of an envelope for class 0, outflows forming a cavity for class I, and the protoplanetary disk for class II. The second row detailed these key features, as well as the age and scale of these objects. An improvement I can make for a next iteration is to i) include an (non-linear) arrow of time at the top with markers that point to these ages, and ii) a scale bar per object to better understand the size of the objects. The third row of information are mock SEDs showing the different components that comprise the SED. The main takeaway is that there is an IR excess present in the SEDs for class 0 / I candidates. Lastly notated is the 'birthline', a very contentious and hotly debated topic, which indicates an example point where a YSO is now considered a pre-main sequence object on an HR diagram. Perhaps adding a question mark at the end of the label ('birthline?') can help better sell the idea that this is not a concrete classification criteria.
