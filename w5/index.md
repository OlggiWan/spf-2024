# Week 5 Learning Objectives
## Tracers of Star Formation
Motivation: Stars don't form in isolation. We observe star-forming regions within our own Galaxy and outside of it, though the observational tracers tend to vary across different scales. In order to understand the broader narrative for star formation, we can construct metrics to guide interpretation of observations. 

### I. YSOs, cores, clumps: The Ontology of Scales in SF
+ Earliest phases of collapse in theory and observation  
*Chapter 9, Williams*  
  + Bonner-Ebert Spheres + External Pressure  
  + Triggered Star Formation: HII region expansion   
  + Cores in Extinction + Molecules
### II. Statistics of SF: Extragalactic studies
*Chapter 11, Williams*   
  + Stellar Initial Mass Function  
  + Gravitation at Larger Scales: Bondi Accretion  
  + Kennicutt-Schmidt Law re-visited
