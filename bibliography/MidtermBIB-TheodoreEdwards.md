[(Pattle et. al. 2022)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11179) *Magnetic fields in star formation: from clouds to core*

In this paper the authors cover a wide breath of topics involving magnetic fields, starting from clouds and going all the way down to pre/protostellar cores.
They begin with an introduction which then goes into the type of measurements used to determine magnetic field strength, one of such being the Zeeman effect.
The authors then explore magnetic clouds, magnetic filaments, and finally cores.  


This is pretty relevant to the material we covered in class, specifically the Zeeman effect, and the magnetic field in relation to the pre/protostellar cores. 


 
[(Ching et. al. 2022)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-04159-x) *An early transition to magnetic supercriticality in star formation*

The authors of the paper use the Zeeman effect to measure the strength of the magnetic field of L1544. More specifically they use the 
HINSA (Hydrogen I narrow self-absorption) to determing the magnetic field, and they find out two things. The first being that the measurements they make are in
alignment with the known and accepted values of measurements. The second is that supercriticality happens a lot sooner in the star formation magnetic field process
that was previously thought to happen. 

Both the Zeeman effect and supercriticality were topics that came up in class when we covered magnetic fields in pre/protostellar cores. In class we learned that
supercriticality pushes back against gravitational collapse. 

[(Crutcher et. al. 2019)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2019.00066/full) *Review of Zeeman Effect Observations of Regions of Star Formation*

The authors provide a robust review of the Zeeman effect, how it's used to measure magnetic fields in astronomy, what molecules used to observe the zeeman effect, and
how the results are interpretted. 


Went over the Zeeman effect in class when talking about magnetic fields in pre/protostellar cores.
