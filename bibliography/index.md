# Annotated Bibliography

*Instructions:*
Using the template below (you can copy/paste) add an entry to this annotated bibliography. A good annotated bibliography entry synthesizes the paper's message, rather than re-wording the abstract. This is a good place to practice reading papers critically. Most papers are motivating and presenting an argument, they tend to have a message and a point of view. Even if the details are highly technical, papers are still required to present a logical argument. As you read, try to identify what claims are being made and assess the validity of the claims. A good starting point is looking for self-consistency between what the paper states as its goals and what is actually being done -- i.e. does it hang together?

Some questions to ask as you read:

1. Are the starting assumptions appropriate for the questions the paper wishes to address?
2. Are the methods/measurements representative of the system described by the starting assumptions? For ex, are they comparing apples to apples?
3. Do the results support the claims being put forth? Are there alternative interpretations you can come up with?
4. Are the claims relevant to the motivation?

> To be eligible for points, uploads should be committed with a commit message title "BIB CONTRIBUTION - [NAME]" with a brief commit description of topic keywords. You are welcome to split the work and credit with a classmate, simply put multiple names in the commit title so that total points can be split between contributors.
