# Annotated Bibliography

*Instructions:*
Using the template below (you can copy/paste) add an entry to this annotated bibliography. A good annotated bibliography entry synthesizes the paper's message, rather than re-wording the abstract. This is a good place to practice reading papers critically. Most papers are motivating and presenting an argument, they tend to have a message and a point of view. Even if the details are highly technical, papers are still required to present a logical argument. As you read, try to identify what claims are being made and assess the validity of the claims. A good starting point is looking for self-consistency between what the paper states as its goals and what is actually being done -- i.e. does it hang together?

Some questions to ask as you read:

1. Are the starting assumptions appropriate for the questions the paper wishes to address?
2. Are the methods/measurements representative of the system described by the starting assumptions? For ex, are they comparing apples to apples?
3. Do the results support the claims being put forth? Are there alternative interpretations you can come up with?
4. Are the claims relevant to the motivation?

*A supersonic turbulence origin of Larson's laws*

The paper takes measurements made out of ISM simulations and attempts to understand how Larson's law hold up. It describes the simulations in detail, and discusses specific effects such as gravity, and their relevance to the outcomes of the simulations. The paper determines that Larson's laws do indeed hold up at larger scales on the 0.1 - 50 pc order, and are a sign of kinetic energy entering a system. It takes the importance of molecular clouds in star formation theory, and works to understand how turbulence and gravity align with Larson's laws, 

This paper obviously discusses Larson's laws, of which we discussed the size-linewidth relation in class. As discussed in class, Larson found the relation as a result of a molecular cloud's internal velocity dispersion, cloud size, and mass. The clouds are theorized to have formed due to regular gravitational turbulence, as well as supersonic turbulence, which we were better able to understand through the example of a SNe remnant.

*Gravity or turbulence V: star-forming regions undergoing violent relaxation*

In this paper, Bonilla-Barroso et. al. explore star cluster formation through simulations, particularly testing two different formation scenarios - a turbulent scenario (TC), and a chaotic collapse scenario. The authors take these scenarios and model them against data of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), of Stars and Planet Formation classroom fame. This is relevant as there is a predominant idea that the formation of the stars in the ONC occurred through a turbulent process. To compare the star cluster formation scenarios, the authors took types of simulations, three runs for each scenario, and used empirical data selected a total of 1989 stars from a selected ONC region, noting their parallax, proper motions, masses, ages, and effective temperatures, using the GAIA-EDR3.
they found that the the global collapse simulations had a relatively flat velocity dispersion. The turbulence simulations showed a range in velocity dispersions, with higher velocity dispersions being associated with higher mass stars, showing a clear difference between the collapse and turbulence scenarios! The ONC histograms also show relatively flat velocity dispersion with no relationship to the masses binned, which visually looked a lot like the collapse scenario. 

I found this paper to be extremely clear to read (thanks Aleksandra!) The paper itself discusses the gravitational collapse vs turbulence star formation scenarios that we discussed in class, and puts them to the test against empirical data (from the ONC which we also learned about in class). This method of comparison is a lot easier on my brain than having to explicitly try and interpret results from a simulation standing on its own. The paper also briefly touches on concepts that are integral to understanding how overdensities play a role in forming stars, namely Larson's law and the Jeans mass. The paper had a clear goal and took the reader from start to finish, and I would highly recommend reading this to see how what we have learned practically applies.


[(Ballesteros-Paredes et. al, 2020)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020SSRv..216...76B/abstract) *From Diffuse Gas to Dense Molecular Cloud Cores*

This paper summarizes current knowledge of molecular clouds (MC) by describing cloud formation, discussing the tools to understand their dynamics, and describing their connection to star formation. The authors link MC properties and lifecycles to their galactic environments, explore the calculations and numerical simulations that investigate MC formation, break down cloud statistics, and look at cloud substructure. The paper supplements and expands on several topics we’ve covered in the course so far, including H2 molecule formation; the use of the virial theorem to describe MC physical states and associated caveats; some MC ensemble properties; interstellar radiation and Habing units; the Salpeter power IMF; the prestellar core mass function; and more. The inclusion of observational and simulation data to visualize certain concepts helps drive them home. Since this paper is in the form of a review, it doesn’t necessarily present a singular argument but uses historical and recent literature to critically discuss hypotheses about MC formation, morphology, link to star formation, etc. I found it to be dense with information but helpful for reviewing our class discussions in a little more detail.


[(Elia et al, 2022)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...941..162E/abstract) *The Star Formation Rate of the Milky Way as seen by Herschel*

In this paper the authors use protostellar clump catalog data from the Herschel Infrared Galactic Plane (Hi-GAL) survey to present a new calculation of the Milky Way’s current star formation rate (SFR), as well as its distribution across the Galactic plane. They select targets whose spectral energy distributions have shapes eligible for a modified black body in the range $160-500 \mu m$ and checked for detection of an emission excess within these targets at $70 \mu m$ for classification as star forming or starless. The authors consider both a few ten thousand protostellar clumps with heliocentric distance determinations and an additional few thousand targets without. To determine each target’s contribution to the SFR, they use theoretical evolutionary tracks from bolometric luminosity vs. mass relations to calculate the final mass of the internal protostar and total elapsed time, accounting for potential distance biases. Using the sources with determined distances, they find the lower limit of the global SFR to be $1.7 \pm 0.6 M_\odot yr^{-1}$, with 84% from within the solar circle and 16% from without. For the targets without distances, they simulate an equivalent number of distances whose distribution follows the one of the known distances and randomly assign them to the sources without distances, repeated 100 times; taking these additional sources into account, the SFR becomes $2.0 \pm 0.7 M_\odot yr^{-1}$. This value is fairly consistent with SFRs in previous literature. The authors also analyze the behavior of the SFR density averaged in concentric rings vs. Galactocentric radius, finding an inner peak at the Central Molecular Zone, followed by a dip corresponding to a shortage of sources, another peak around 5kpc, and a systematic decrease at larger distances; this behavior is qualitatively similar to profiles found in previous work. Ultimately the authors find that the relation between SFR density and molecular gas surface density Galactocentric profile follows a Kennicutt-Schmidt behavior (beyond 3 kpc).

This paper covers a few topics that we’ve discussed in class, such as emission from clouds, the Kennicutt relation, the discrepancy between theoretical Milky Way star formation efficiency and observations, and the complexity of calculating SFR with proxy measurements, not just with the method used to tally source contributions to the global SFR used in this paper but also various other methods mentioned by the authors. This paper seems good for referencing methods and results in historical and recent literature.

[(Brinch, C., et. al, 200Y)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2007/45/aa8249-07/aa8249-07.html) *A deeply embedded young protoplanetary disk around L1489 IRS observed by the Submillimeter Array**

In this paper, Brinch et. al observationally probe the L1489 IRS system's protostar to search for a Keplerian circumstellar disk. Written in 2007, this paper was one of the earlier proponents of pointing observational tools to low-mass protostars to check for circumstellar disks. They selected this protostar for observation based on the mass of the envelope seen. The authors observed the $HCO^+$ tracer using the Submillimeter Array at Mauna Kea, evidence of a collapsing envelope with an embedded Keplerian disk.      

This paper discusses a couple of relevant topics to our course and is a wonderful way of seeing how observations can lead to theoretical work to further prove the existence of theorized objects. The authors use SEDs and dust continuum observations to put together an image of the disk's shape, as well as find emission peaks for $HCO^+$. Their analysis of the spectra includes discussions of the wings of the emission and the resolution of their data relative to the scales they would expect to see disk structures at!

This is the introductory paper to the Early Planet Formation in Embedded Disks (eDisk) program. The goal of this paper is to act as a primer for the multiple papers published out of this survey by discussing the background motivations, the selected protostellar disks, the observations and data reduction, and some exciting novel results.

I used this paper as my first resource when writing for the midterm as it held relevance and recency for Class 0/I disks. I found that this was a good paper to broadly go through. It has discussions of the rotational velocities of disks, showing the importance of Keplerian velocities/rotation to prove that they researchers are looking at disks, and further for seeing the regions that tracers outline (within/outside of the disk region). It further discusses the way in which they selected their observational areas, which were star forming regions, and how they selected sources with available SEDs to grasp whether they were looking at Class 0 or Class I protostars.  

[(Wurster 2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021MNRAS.501.5873W/abstract) *Do we need non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic to model protostellar discs?*

This paper aims to reinforce that in order to create a realistic description of protostellar disk formation and evolution we need to include non-ideal MHD processes (e.g. Ohmic resistivity, the Hall effect, and ambipolar diffusion); the paper is meant to provide a more complete discussion of these effects. The author begins with a review of previous observational studies and the motivation for not only investigating the precise contributions of non-ideal MHD effects to the disk but also updating the simple traditional picture of dominance of Ohmic resistivity in the mid-plane close to the star, ambipolar diffusion dominance in the outer disk, and dominance of the Hall effect in between. In this study the author considers idealized disks with various magnetic field strengths and 3 different dust grain distributions, gets non-ideal coefficients for each disk, and relates these to disk properties to determine relative importance within the disk. The author presents an updated picture on the dominance of various non-ideal MHD effects which are dependent on factors such as region within the disk, geometry of the magnetic field, etc. The author goes on to consider self-consistently formed disks and fold in additional elements such as the influence of isolated vs. cluster environments. Ultimately the author concludes that even with idealized disks it is difficult to reproduce the simple traditional picture, and that in most self-consistently modeled scenarios all non-ideal MHD effects play non-trivial roles to some extent.

The structure of the idealized disks in this study involve many of the same disk characteristics that we reviewed in class (e.g. Pringle density profile, scale height, etc.). The paper shows Elsasser and Reynolds numbers, also discussed in class, for the considered disks to quantify the role of non-ideal MHD in disk evolution. I found this paper to be comprehensive in its discussion of non-ideal MHD in disks and their dependence on various factors.

[(Rafikov 2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017ApJ...837..163R/abstract) *Protoplanetary Disks as (Possibly) Viscous Disks*

In this paper, the author explores the viscous evolution of protoplanetary disks using 26 disks resolved by ALMA with measured gas and dust masses and accretion rates. The author uses these to get the viscosity parameter $\alpha$ with the goal of differentiating between different mechanisms of angular momentum transport, e.g. viscosity and MHD winds, etc. The author tries 3 different disk temperature assumptions to calculate $\alpha$ but finds that this doesn’t result in large differences for the parameter values, which span a range from $10^{-4} - 0.04$ with no preferred value - indicating that there doesn’t seem to be a single transport mechanism setting the value. The values do not seem to have significant correlations with global disk or stellar characteristics (e.g. disk mass, size, surface density, stellar luminosity, etc.) but shows strong linear correlation with the central mass accretion rate. The author considers a few explanations for why this correlation might exist and not others, such as whether there is an unobserved variable setting the relation.

I found this paper interesting because it discusses many of the disk concepts we’ve covered, such as the LBP diffusion evolution of disks, the Shakura-Sunyaev $\alpha$-prescriptions for disks, and observation methods of recovering disk properties (using UV excess to get accretion rates, using CO line measurements for gas mass). It was interesting to see the use of observational results to try to constrain physical processes in action with the same equations that we studied in class.

This paper uses a two-fluid hydrodynamics simulation to investigate the interaction of gas and dust in a protoplanetary disk in the presence of a massive planet. The study focuses on the conditions for gap formation in the dust fluid. Although a gap in the disk has been seen when planets more massive than 1 Jupiter mass are present, the study also suggests that planets as small as 0.1 Jupiter masses can create gaps in protoplanetary dust disks. The two-fluid hydrodynamics code treated dust as a pressureless fluid governed by conservation laws, with a focus on focusing on drag forces and hight numerical resolution. The difference between the equations for the gas and dust is the absence of pressure in the latter. The dust fluid behaves like a gas that is moving with supersonic velocity. The study focused on measuring several key outcomes, including the formation of an annular gap in the dust disk by a planet and determining the minimum planet mass required for gap formation. Additionally, the study examined the decoupling of larger particles from the gas, the dominance of larger particles in the opacity at millimeter wavelengths, and the enhancement of contrast between the inside of the gap and the gap edges. I chose this paper because it relates to the topics covered in the last two weeks of classes, dust gaps in gas disks, and is one of the older articles I found. 

[(Kley, Nelson, 2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1184) *Planet-Disk Interaction and Orbital Evolution* - Rosario Cecilio-Flores-Elie

This paper provides a detailed review of planet-disk interactions, migration modes, and torque influences on planetary evolution, emphasizing the importance of disk-planet interactions in shaping planetary systems. The methodology involves reviewing disk-planet interactions, focusing on migration speed and direction. Various torques, disk properties, and the roles of self-gravity and turbulence are considered. The study discusses the evolution of low-mass and massive planets in protoplanetary disks. Some main findings looked into the challenge of explaining hot Jupiters through models, suggesting large-scale migration. The significance of resonant or near-resonant multiple systems of transiting planets was discovered by the Kepler mission. Overall, the paper does a comprehensive review of the mechanisms and processes governing disk-planet interactions, particularly focusing on how these interactions influence the migration and orbital evolution 0of planets within protoplanetary disks. Some limitations included the need for theoretical, computational, and observational developments to improve models of the planet formation environment, with a focus on structural evolution over time. This paper relates to week 14. 

[(Fedele et. al, 2017)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.05185) *ALMA continuum observations of the protoplanetary disk AS 209. Evidence of multiple gaps opened by a single planet* - Rosario Cecilio-Flores-Elie

The paper presents ALMA observations of the protoplanetary system AS 209, revealing the presence of a giant planet responsible for the outer gap and a smaller inner planet indicated by the inner gap. This suggests the rapid formation of giant planets in young systems. The study involved using the dust radiative transfer code DALI to determine dust grain surface density and comparing it with 3D hydrodynamical simulations to understand gap formation in the disk. The presence of multiple gaps in the protoplanetary disk AS 209 was found, with a specific focus on the gap at 62 au and 103 au suggesting a giant planet responsible for the outer gap at approximately 0.8  times the mass of Saturn. The inner planet is suggested to be less than 0.1 Jupiter masses and the presence of a Saturn-like planet at around 95 au in the disk. This raises questions about planet formation at such large distances from the star. A limitation of this study is the exhaustive fit to the data due to the expense of hydrodynamic simulations and the restriction of pebble accretion in the inner disk to the earliest phase of disk evolution.

The paper focuses on deriving physical properties such as optical depth, gas density, and metallicity in the central region of the starburst galaxy NGC 253 using spectroscopic observations from various telescopes. This results in values for gas phase abundance estimates for optical depth and determination of ionized gas with a solar metallicity value. The methodology in this study involved utilizing ratios of intergraded line fluxes to derive gas density and metallicity, employing a Monte-Carlo approach to determine line fluxes and statistical uncertainties, and using ratios of MIR and FIR integrated line fluxes to determine ISM parameters. Monte-Carlo was applied to obtain density from line flux rations and propagate uncertainties in the Ne/H abundance ratio. One limitation of this study is that it does not provide a conclusive answer to the major energy input to the ISM due to the presence of various components. This paper connects to Week 1: Phases of the ISM. 

[(Stelzer et. al, 2009)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009A%26A...507..227S/abstract) *A Chandra and Spitzer census of the young star cluster in the reflection nebula NGC 7129*

The authors of this paper conduct a Chandra survey to complete a holistic classification of the YSOs that live in the reflection nebula NGC 7129. They utlize their new observations, which include photometry and SEDs, with both archival optical and infrared data to carry out their data analysis and classification. Using this new data, they are able to identify a population class II / class III YSO candidates that have X-ray sources, and a population of class 0/I and II that do not down to a mass completion limit of 0.5 $M_\odot$. Further disentangling class 0/I and class II disks requires better IR SED information, which is not possible at the time due to the (then) poor resolution of IR instruments. 
 
The relationship to the course material is in how we can use YSO spectra and photometry to both classify them and distinguish them from each other. Infrared wavelengths can help classify Class 0/I and II disks due to the IR excess from dust, for example. The paper also discusses how the nebula is ~ 3 Myr old, right around when the disk disappears, helping contextualize the timescales of protoplanetary disk evolution as mentioned in class.
