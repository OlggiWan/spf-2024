# Annotated Bibliography

*Instructions:*
Using the template below (you can copy/paste) add an entry to this annotated bibliography. A good annotated bibliography entry synthesizes the paper's message, rather than re-wording the abstract. This is a good place to practice reading papers critically. Most papers are motivating and presenting an argument, they tend to have a message and a point of view. Even if the details are highly technical, papers are still required to present a logical argument. As you read, try to identify what claims are being made and assess the validity of the claims. A good starting point is looking for self-consistency between what the paper states as its goals and what is actually being done -- i.e. does it hang together?

Some questions to ask as you read:

1. Are the starting assumptions appropriate for the questions the paper wishes to address?
2. Are the methods/measurements representative of the system described by the starting assumptions? For ex, are they comparing apples to apples?
3. Do the results support the claims being put forth? Are there alternative interpretations you can come up with?
4. Are the claims relevant to the motivation?

You are welcome to split the work and credit with a classmate, simply put multiple names in the commit title so that total points can be split between contributors.

*A supersonic turbulence origin of Larson's laws*

The paper takes measurements made out of ISM simulations and attempts to understand how Larson's law hold up. It describes the simulations in detail, and discusses specific effects such as gravity, and their relevance to the outcomes of the simulations. The paper determines that Larson's laws do indeed hold up at larger scales on the 0.1 - 50 pc order, and are a sign of kinetic energy entering a system. It takes the importance of molecular clouds in star formation theory, and works to understand how turbulence and gravity align with Larson's laws, 

This paper obviously discusses Larson's laws, of which we discussed the size-linewidth relation in class. As discussed in class, Larson found the relation as a result of a molecular cloud's internal velocity dispersion, cloud size, and mass. The clouds are theorized to have formed due to regular gravitational turbulence, as well as supersonic turbulence, which we were better able to understand through the example of a SNe remnant.

*Gravity or turbulence V: star-forming regions undergoing violent relaxation*

In this paper, Bonilla-Barroso et. al. explore star cluster formation through simulations, particularly testing two different formation scenarios - a turbulent scenario (TC), and a chaotic collapse scenario. The authors take these scenarios and model them against data of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC), of Stars and Planet Formation classroom fame. This is relevant as there is a predominant idea that the formation of the stars in the ONC occurred through a turbulent process. To compare the star cluster formation scenarios, the authors took types of simulations, three runs for each scenario, and used empirical data selected a total of 1989 stars from a selected ONC region, noting their parallax, proper motions, masses, ages, and effective temperatures, using the GAIA-EDR3.
they found that the the global collapse simulations had a relatively flat velocity dispersion. The turbulence simulations showed a range in velocity dispersions, with higher velocity dispersions being associated with higher mass stars, showing a clear difference between the collapse and turbulence scenarios! The ONC histograms also show relatively flat velocity dispersion with no relationship to the masses binned, which visually looked a lot like the collapse scenario. 

I found this paper to be extremely clear to read (thanks Aleksandra!) The paper itself discusses the gravitational collapse vs turbulence star formation scenarios that we discussed in class, and puts them to the test against empirical data (from the ONC which we also learned about in class). This method of comparison is a lot easier on my brain than having to explicitly try and interpret results from a simulation standing on its own. The paper also briefly touches on concepts that are integral to understanding how overdensities play a role in forming stars, namely Larson's law and the Jeans mass. The paper had a clear goal and took the reader from start to finish, and I would highly recommend reading this to see how what we have learned practically applies.
