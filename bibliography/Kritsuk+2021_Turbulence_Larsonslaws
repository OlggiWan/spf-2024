[Kritsuk et. al. 2021](https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.5926) *A supersonic turbulence origin of Larson's laws*

Paragraph: The paper takes measurements made out of ISM simulations and attempts to understand how Larson's law hold up.
It describes the simulations in detail, and discusses specific effects such as gravity, and their relevance to the outcomes of the simulations.
The paper determines that Larson's laws do indeed hold up at larger scales on the 0.1 - 50 pc order, and are a sign of kinetic energy entering a system.
It takes the importance of molecular clouds in star formation theory, and works to understand how turbulence and gravity align with Larson's laws, 

  This paper obviously discusses Larson's laws, of which we discussed the size-linewidth relation in class. 
As discussed in class, Larson found the relation as a result of a molecular cloud's internal velocity dispersion, cloud size, and mass.
The clouds are theorized to have formed due to regular gravitational turbulence, as well as supersonic turbulence, which we 
were better able to understand through the example of a SNe remnant.
